# Welcome to Gemini CLI documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to installing, using, and developing Gemini CLI. This tool lets you interact with Gemini models through a command-line interface.

## Overview

Gemini CLI brings the capabilities of Gemini models to your terminal in an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) environment. Gemini CLI consists of a client-side application (`packages/cli`) that communicates with a local server (`packages/core`), which in turn manages requests to the Gemini API and its AI models. Gemini CLI also contains a variety of tools for tasks such as performing file system operations, running shells, and web fetching, which are managed by `packages/core`.

# Gemini CLI Execution and Deployment

This document describes how to run Gemini CLI and explains the deployment architecture that Gemini CLI uses.

## Running Gemini CLI

There are several ways to run Gemini CLI. The option you choose depends on how you intend to use Gemini CLI.

---

### 1. Standard installation (Recommended for typical users)

This is the recommended way for end-users to install Gemini CLI. It involves downloading the Gemini CLI package from the NPM registry.

- **Global install:**

  ```bash
  # Install the CLI globally
  npm install -g @google/gemini-cli

  # Now you can run the CLI from anywhere
  gemini
  ```

- **NPX execution:**
  ```bash
  # Execute the latest version from NPM without a global install
  npx @google/gemini-cli
  ```

---

### 2. Running in a sandbox (Docker/Podman)

For security and isolation, Gemini CLI can be run inside a container. This is the default way that the CLI executes tools that might have side effects.

- **Directly from the Registry:**
  You can run the published sandbox image directly. This is useful for environments where you only have Docker and want to run the CLI.
  ```bash
  # Run the published sandbox image
  docker run --rm -it us-docker.pkg.dev/gemini-code-dev/gemini-cli/sandbox:0.1.1
  ```
- **Using the `--sandbox` flag:**
  If you have Gemini CLI installed locally (using the standard installation described above), you can instruct it to run inside the sandbox container.
  ```bash
  gemini --sandbox "your prompt here"
  ```

---

### 3. Running from source (Recommended for Gemini CLI contributors)

Contributors to the project will want to run the CLI directly from the source code.

- **Development Mode:**
  This method provides hot-reloading and is useful for active development.
  ```bash
  # From the root of the repository
  npm run start
  ```
- **Production-like mode (Linked package):**
  This method simulates a global installation by linking your local package. It's useful for testing a local build in a production workflow.

  ```bash
  # Link the local cli package to your global node_modules
  npm link packages/cli

  # Now you can run your local version using the `gemini` command
  gemini
  ```

---

### 4. Running the latest Gemini CLI commit from GitHub

You can run the most recently committed version of Gemini CLI directly from the GitHub repository. This is useful for testing features still in development.

```bash
# Execute the CLI directly from the main branch on GitHub
npx https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
```

## Deployment architecture

The execution methods described above are made possible by the following architectural components and processes:

**NPM packages**

Gemini CLI project is a monorepo that publishes two core packages to the NPM registry:

- `@google/gemini-cli-core`: The backend, handling logic and tool execution.
- `@google/gemini-cli`: The user-facing frontend.

These packages are used when performing the standard installation and when running Gemini CLI from the source.

**Build and packaging processes**

There are two distinct build processes used, depending on the distribution channel:

- **NPM publication:** For publishing to the NPM registry, the TypeScript source code in `@google/gemini-cli-core` and `@google/gemini-cli` is transpiled into standard JavaScript using the TypeScript Compiler (`tsc`). The resulting `dist/` directory is what gets published in the NPM package. This is a standard approach for TypeScript libraries.

- **GitHub `npx` execution:** When running the latest version of Gemini CLI directly from GitHub, a different process is triggered by the `prepare` script in `package.json`. This script uses `esbuild` to bundle the entire application and its dependencies into a single, self-contained JavaScript file. This bundle is created on-the-fly on the user's machine and is not checked into the repository.

**Docker sandbox image**

The Docker-based execution method is supported by the `gemini-cli-sandbox` container image. This image is published to a container registry and contains a pre-installed, global version of Gemini CLI. The `scripts/prepare-cli-packagejson.js` script dynamically injects the URI of this image into the CLI's `package.json` before publishing, so the CLI knows which image to pull when the `--sandbox` flag is used.

## Release process

A unified script, `npm run publish:release`, orchestrates the release process. The script performs the following actions:

1.  Build the NPM packages using `tsc`.
2.  Update the CLI's `package.json` with the Docker image URI.
3.  Build and tag the `gemini-cli-sandbox` Docker image.
4.  Push the Docker image to the container registry.
5.  Publish the NPM packages to the artifact registry.

# Gemini CLI Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the Gemini CLI's architecture.

## Core components

The Gemini CLI is primarily composed of two main packages, along with a suite of tools that can be used by the system in the course of handling command-line input:

1.  **CLI package (`packages/cli`):**

    - **Purpose:** This contains the user-facing portion of the Gemini CLI, such as handling the initial user input, presenting the final output, and managing the overall user experience.
    - **Key functions contained in the package:**
      - [Input processing](./cli/commands.md)
      - History management
      - Display rendering
      - [Theme and UI customization](./cli/themes.md)
      - [CLI configuration settings](./cli/configuration.md)

2.  **Core package (`packages/core`):**

    - **Purpose:** This acts as the backend for the Gemini CLI. It receives requests sent from `packages/cli`, orchestrates interactions with the Gemini API, and manages the execution of available tools.
    - **Key functions contained in the package:**
      - API client for communicating with the Google Gemini API
      - Prompt construction and management
      - Tool registration and execution logic
      - State management for conversations or sessions
      - Server-side configuration

3.  **Tools (`packages/core/src/tools/`):**
    - **Purpose:** These are individual modules that extend the capabilities of the Gemini model, allowing it to interact with the local environment (e.g., file system, shell commands, web fetching).
    - **Interaction:** `packages/core` invokes these tools based on requests from the Gemini model.

## Interaction Flow

A typical interaction with the Gemini CLI follows this flow:

1.  **User input:** The user types a prompt or command into the terminal, which is managed by `packages/cli`.
2.  **Request to core:** `packages/cli` sends the user's input to `packages/core`.
3.  **Request processed:** The core package:
    - Constructs an appropriate prompt for the Gemini API, possibly including conversation history and available tool definitions.
    - Sends the prompt to the Gemini API.
4.  **Gemini API response:** The Gemini API processes the prompt and returns a response. This response might be a direct answer or a request to use one of the available tools.
5.  **Tool execution (if applicable):**
    - When the Gemini API requests a tool, the core package prepares to execute it.
    - If the requested tool can modify the file system or execute shell commands, the user is first given details of the tool and its arguments, and the user must approve the execution.
    - Read-only operations, such as reading files, might not require explicit user confirmation to proceed.
    - Once confirmed, or if confirmation is not required, the core package executes the relevant action within the relevant tool, and the result is sent back to the Gemini API by the core package.
    - The Gemini API processes the tool result and generates a final response.
6.  **Response to CLI:** The core package sends the final response back to the CLI package.
7.  **Display to user:** The CLI package formats and displays the response to the user in the terminal.

## Key Design Principles

- **Modularity:** Separating the CLI (frontend) from the Core (backend) allows for independent development and potential future extensions (e.g., different frontends for the same backend).
- **Extensibility:** The tool system is designed to be extensible, allowing new capabilities to be added.
- **User experience:** The CLI focuses on providing a rich and interactive terminal experience.

# Gemini CLI

Within Gemini CLI, `packages/cli` is the frontend for users to send and receive prompts with the Gemini AI model and its associated tools. For a general overview of Gemini CLI, see the [main documentation page](../index.md).

## Non-interactive mode

Gemini CLI can be run in a non-interactive mode, which is useful for scripting and automation. In this mode, you pipe input to the CLI, it executes the command, and then it exits.

The following example pipes a command to Gemini CLI from your terminal:

```bash
echo "What is fine tuning?" | gemini
```

Gemini CLI executes the command and prints the output to your terminal. Note that you can achieve the same behavior by using the `--prompt` or `-p` flag. For example:

```bash
gemini -p "What is fine tuning?"
```

# CLI Commands

Gemini CLI supports several built-in commands to help you manage your session, customize the interface, and control its behavior. These commands are prefixed with a forward slash (`/`), an at symbol (`@`), or an exclamation mark (`!`).

## Slash commands (`/`)

Slash commands provide meta-level control over the CLI itself.

- **`/bug`**

  - **Description:** File an issue about Gemini CLI. By default, the issue is filed within the GitHub repository for Gemini CLI. The string you enter after `/bug` will become the headline for the bug being filed. The default `/bug` behavior can be modified using the `bugCommand` setting in your `.gemini/settings.json` files.

- **`/chat`**

  - **Description:** Save and resume conversation history for branching conversation state interactively, or resuming a previous state from a later session.
  - **Sub-commands:**
    - **`save`**
      - **Description:** Saves the current conversation history. You must add a `<tag>` for identifying the conversation state.
      - **Usage:** `/chat save <tag>`
    - **`resume`**
      - **Description:** Resumes a conversation from a previous save.
      - **Usage:** `/chat resume <tag>`
    - **`list`**
      - **Description:** Lists available tags for chat state resumption.

- **`/clear`**

  - **Description:** Clear the terminal screen, including the visible session history and scrollback within the CLI. The underlying session data (for history recall) might be preserved depending on the exact implementation, but the visual display is cleared.
  - **Keyboard shortcut:** Press **Ctrl+L** at any time to perform a clear action.

- **`/compress`**

  - **Description:** Replace the entire chat context with a summary. This saves on tokens used for future tasks while retaining a high level summary of what has happened.

- **`/editor`**

  - **Description:** Open a dialog for selecting supported editors.

- **`/help`** (or **`/?`**)

  - **Description:** Display help information about the Gemini CLI, including available commands and their usage.

- **`/mcp`**

  - **Description:** List configured Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, their connection status, server details, and available tools.
  - **Sub-commands:**
    - **`desc`** or **`descriptions`**:
      - **Description:** Show detailed descriptions for MCP servers and tools.
    - **`nodesc`** or **`nodescriptions`**:
      - **Description:** Hide tool descriptions, showing only the tool names.
    - **`schema`**:
      - **Description:** Show the full JSON schema for the tool's configured parameters.
  - **Keyboard Shortcut:** Press **Ctrl+T** at any time to toggle between showing and hiding tool descriptions.

- **`/memory`**

  - **Description:** Manage the AI's instructional context (hierarchical memory loaded from `GEMINI.md` files).
  - **Sub-commands:**
    - **`add`**:
      - **Description:** Adds the following text to the AI's memory. Usage: `/memory add <text to remember>`
    - **`show`**:
      - **Description:** Display the full, concatenated content of the current hierarchical memory that has been loaded from all `GEMINI.md` files. This lets you inspect the instructional context being provided to the Gemini model.
    - **`refresh`**:
      - **Description:** Reload the hierarchical instructional memory from all `GEMINI.md` files found in the configured locations (global, project/ancestors, and sub-directories). This command updates the model with the latest `GEMINI.md` content.
    - **Note:** For more details on how `GEMINI.md` files contribute to hierarchical memory, see the [CLI Configuration documentation](./configuration.md#4-geminimd-files-hierarchical-instructional-context).

- **`/restore`**

  - **Description:** Restores the project files to the state they were in just before a tool was executed. This is particularly useful for undoing file edits made by a tool. If run without a tool call ID, it will list available checkpoints to restore from.
  - **Usage:** `/restore [tool_call_id]`
  - **Note:** Only available if the CLI is invoked with the `--checkpointing` option or configured via [settings](./configuration.md). See [Checkpointing documentation](../checkpointing.md) for more details.

- **`/stats`**

  - **Description:** Display detailed statistics for the current Gemini CLI session, including token usage, cached token savings (when available), and session duration. Note: Cached token information is only displayed when cached tokens are being used, which occurs with API key authentication but not with OAuth authentication at this time.

- [**`/theme`**](./themes.md)

  - **Description:** Open a dialog that lets you change the visual theme of Gemini CLI.

- **`/auth`**

  - **Description:** Open a dialog that lets you change the authentication method.

- **`/about`**

  - **Description:** Show version info. Please share this information when filing issues.

- [**`/tools`**](../tools/index.md)

  - **Description:** Display a list of tools that are currently available within Gemini CLI.
  - **Sub-commands:**
    - **`desc`** or **`descriptions`**:
      - **Description:** Show detailed descriptions of each tool, including each tool's name with its full description as provided to the model.
    - **`nodesc`** or **`nodescriptions`**:
      - **Description:** Hide tool descriptions, showing only the tool names.

- **`/quit`** (or **`/exit`**)

  - **Description:** Exit Gemini CLI.

## At commands (`@`)

At commands are used to include the content of files or directories as part of your prompt to Gemini. These commands include git-aware filtering.

- **`@<path_to_file_or_directory>`**

  - **Description:** Inject the content of the specified file or files into your current prompt. This is useful for asking questions about specific code, text, or collections of files.
  - **Examples:**
    - `@path/to/your/file.txt Explain this text.`
    - `@src/my_project/ Summarize the code in this directory.`
    - `What is this file about? @README.md`
  - **Details:**
    - If a path to a single file is provided, the content of that file is read.
    - If a path to a directory is provided, the command attempts to read the content of files within that directory and any subdirectories.
    - Spaces in paths should be escaped with a backslash (e.g., `@My\ Documents/file.txt`).
    - The command uses the `read_many_files` tool internally. The content is fetched and then inserted into your query before being sent to the Gemini model.
    - **Git-aware filtering:** By default, git-ignored files (like `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.env`, `.git/`) are excluded. This behavior can be changed via the `fileFiltering` settings.
    - **File types:** The command is intended for text-based files. While it might attempt to read any file, binary files or very large files might be skipped or truncated by the underlying `read_many_files` tool to ensure performance and relevance. The tool indicates if files were skipped.
  - **Output:** The CLI will show a tool call message indicating that `read_many_files` was used, along with a message detailing the status and the path(s) that were processed.

- **`@` (Lone at symbol)**
  - **Description:** If you type a lone `@` symbol without a path, the query is passed as-is to the Gemini model. This might be useful if you are specifically talking _about_ the `@` symbol in your prompt.

### Error handling for `@` commands

- If the path specified after `@` is not found or is invalid, an error message will be displayed, and the query might not be sent to the Gemini model, or it will be sent without the file content.
- If the `read_many_files` tool encounters an error (e.g., permission issues), this will also be reported.

## Shell mode & passthrough commands (`!`)

The `!` prefix lets you interact with your system's shell directly from within Gemini CLI.

- **`!<shell_command>`**

  - **Description:** Execute the given `<shell_command>` in your system's default shell. Any output or errors from the command are displayed in the terminal.
  - **Examples:**
    - `!ls -la` (executes `ls -la` and returns to Gemini CLI)
    - `!git status` (executes `git status` and returns to Gemini CLI)

- **`!` (Toggle shell mode)**

  - **Description:** Typing `!` on its own toggles shell mode.
    - **Entering shell mode:**
      - When active, shell mode uses a different coloring and a "Shell Mode Indicator".
      - While in shell mode, text you type is interpreted directly as a shell command.
    - **Exiting shell mode:**
      - When exited, the UI reverts to its standard appearance and normal Gemini CLI behavior resumes.

- **Caution for all `!` usage:** Commands you execute in shell mode have the same permissions and impact as if you ran them directly in your terminal.


# Gemini CLI Configuration

Gemini CLI offers several ways to configure its behavior, including environment variables, command-line arguments, and settings files. This document outlines the different configuration methods and available settings.

## Configuration layers

Configuration is applied in the following order of precedence (lower numbers are overridden by higher numbers):

1.  **Default values:** Hardcoded defaults within the application.
2.  **User settings file:** Global settings for the current user.
3.  **Project settings file:** Project-specific settings.
4.  **Environment variables:** System-wide or session-specific variables, potentially loaded from `.env` files.
5.  **Command-line arguments:** Values passed when launching the CLI.

## The user settings file and project settings file

Gemini CLI uses `settings.json` files for persistent configuration. There are two locations for these files:

- **User settings file:**
  - **Location:** `~/.gemini/settings.json` (where `~` is your home directory).
  - **Scope:** Applies to all Gemini CLI sessions for the current user.
- **Project settings file:**
  - **Location:** `.gemini/settings.json` within your project's root directory.
  - **Scope:** Applies only when running Gemini CLI from that specific project. Project settings override user settings.

**Note on environment variables in settings:** String values within your `settings.json` files can reference environment variables using either `$VAR_NAME` or `${VAR_NAME}` syntax. These variables will be automatically resolved when the settings are loaded. For example, if you have an environment variable `MY_API_TOKEN`, you could use it in `settings.json` like this: `"apiKey": "$MY_API_TOKEN"`.

### The `.gemini` directory in your project

In addition to a project settings file, a project's `.gemini` directory can contain other project-specific files related to Gemini CLI's operation, such as:

- [Custom sandbox profiles](#sandboxing) (e.g., `.gemini/sandbox-macos-custom.sb`, `.gemini/sandbox.Dockerfile`).

### Available settings in `settings.json`:

- **`contextFileName`** (string or array of strings):

  - **Description:** Specifies the filename for context files (e.g., `GEMINI.md`, `AGENTS.md`). Can be a single filename or a list of accepted filenames.
  - **Default:** `GEMINI.md`
  - **Example:** `"contextFileName": "AGENTS.md"`

- **`bugCommand`** (object):

  - **Description:** Overrides the default URL for the `/bug` command.
  - **Default:** `"urlTemplate": "https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml&title={title}&info={info}"`
  - **Properties:**
    - **`urlTemplate`** (string): A URL that can contain `{title}` and `{info}` placeholders.
  - **Example:**
    ```json
    "bugCommand": {
      "urlTemplate": "https://bug.example.com/new?title={title}&info={info}"
    }
    ```

- **`fileFiltering`** (object):

  - **Description:** Controls git-aware file filtering behavior for @ commands and file discovery tools.
  - **Default:** `"respectGitIgnore": true, "enableRecursiveFileSearch": true`
  - **Properties:**
    - **`respectGitIgnore`** (boolean): Whether to respect .gitignore patterns when discovering files. When set to `true`, git-ignored files (like `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.env`) are automatically excluded from @ commands and file listing operations.
    - **`enableRecursiveFileSearch`** (boolean): Whether to enable searching recursively for filenames under the current tree when completing @ prefixes in the prompt.
  - **Example:**
    ```json
    "fileFiltering": {
      "respectGitIgnore": true,
      "enableRecursiveFileSearch": false
    }
    ```

- **`coreTools`** (array of strings):

  - **Description:** Allows you to specify a list of core tool names that should be made available to the model. This can be used to restrict the set of built-in tools. See [Built-in Tools](../core/tools-api.md#built-in-tools) for a list of core tools.
  - **Default:** All tools available for use by the Gemini model.
  - **Example:** `"coreTools": ["ReadFileTool", "GlobTool", "SearchText"]`.

- **`excludeTools`** (array of strings):

  - **Description:** Allows you to specify a list of core tool names that should be excluded from the model. A tool listed in both `excludeTools` and `coreTools` is excluded.
  - **Default**: No tools excluded.
  - **Example:** `"excludeTools": ["run_shell_command", "findFiles"]`.

- **`autoAccept`** (boolean):

  - **Description:** Controls whether the CLI automatically accepts and executes tool calls that are considered safe (e.g., read-only operations) without explicit user confirmation. If set to `true`, the CLI will bypass the confirmation prompt for tools deemed safe.
  - **Default:** `false`
  - **Example:** `"autoAccept": true`

- **`theme`** (string):

  - **Description:** Sets the visual [theme](./themes.md) for Gemini CLI.
  - **Default:** `"Default"`
  - **Example:** `"theme": "GitHub"`

- **`sandbox`** (boolean or string):

  - **Description:** Controls whether and how to use sandboxing for tool execution. If set to `true`, Gemini CLI uses a pre-built `gemini-cli-sandbox` Docker image. For more information, see [Sandboxing](#sandboxing).
  - **Default:** `false`
  - **Example:** `"sandbox": "docker"`

- **`toolDiscoveryCommand`** (string):

  - **Description:** Defines a custom shell command for discovering tools from your project. The shell command must return on `stdout` a JSON array of [function declarations](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling#function-declarations). Tool wrappers are optional.
  - **Default:** Empty
  - **Example:** `"toolDiscoveryCommand": "bin/get_tools"`

- **`toolCallCommand`** (string):

  - **Description:** Defines a custom shell command for calling a specific tool that was discovered using `toolDiscoveryCommand`. The shell command must meet the following criteria:
    - It must take function `name` (exactly as in [function declaration](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling#function-declarations)) as first command line argument.
    - It must read function arguments as JSON on `stdin`, analogous to [`functionCall.args`](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference#functioncall).
    - It must return function output as JSON on `stdout`, analogous to [`functionResponse.response.content`](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference#functionresponse).
  - **Default:** Empty
  - **Example:** `"toolCallCommand": "bin/call_tool"`

- **`mcpServers`** (object):

  - **Description:** Configures connections to one or more Model-Context Protocol (MCP) servers for discovering and using custom tools. Gemini CLI attempts to connect to each configured MCP server to discover available tools. If multiple MCP servers expose a tool with the same name, the tool names will be prefixed with the server alias you defined in the configuration (e.g., `serverAlias__actualToolName`) to avoid conflicts. Note that the system might strip certain schema properties from MCP tool definitions for compatibility.
  - **Default:** Empty
  - **Properties:**
    - **`<SERVER_NAME>`** (object): The server parameters for the named server.
      - `command` (string, required): The command to execute to start the MCP server.

        "env": {
          "API_KEY": "$MY_API_TOKEN"
        }
      },
    }
    ```

- **`checkpointing`** (object):

    "otlpEndpoint": "http://localhost:4317",
    "logPrompts": true
  },
  "usageStatisticsEnabled": true
}
```

## Shell History

The CLI keeps a history of shell commands you run. To avoid conflicts between different projects, this history is stored in a project-specific directory within your user's home folder.

- **Location:** `~/.gemini/tmp/<project_hash>/shell_history`
  - `<project_hash>` is a unique identifier generated from your project's root path.
  - The history is stored in a file named `shell_history`.

## Environment Variables & `.env` Files

Environment variables are a common way to configure applications, especially for sensitive information like API keys or for settings that might change between environments.

The CLI automatically loads environment variables from an `.env` file. The loading order is:

1.  `.env` file in the current working directory.
2.  If not found, it searches upwards in parent directories until it finds an `.env` file or reaches the project root (identified by a `.git` folder) or the home directory.
3.  If still not found, it looks for `~/.env` (in the user's home directory).

- **`GEMINI_API_KEY`** (Required):
  - Your API key for the Gemini API.
  - **Crucial for operation.** The CLI will not function without it.
  - Set this in your shell profile (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`) or an `.env` file.
- **`GEMINI_MODEL`**:
  - Specifies the default Gemini model to use.
  - Overrides the hardcoded default
  - Example: `export GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-2.5-flash"`
- **`GOOGLE_API_KEY`**:
  - Your Google Cloud API key.
  - Required for using Vertex AI in express mode.
  - Ensure you have the necessary permissions and set the `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true` environment variable.
  - Example: `export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"`.
- **`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`**:
  - Your Google Cloud Project ID.
  - Required for using Code Assist or Vertex AI.
  - If using Vertex AI, ensure you have the necessary permissions and set the `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true` environment variable.
  - Example: `export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"`.
- **`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`** (string):
  - **Description:** The path to your Google Application Credentials JSON file.
  - **Example:** `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/credentials.json"`
- **`OTLP_GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`**:
  - Your Google Cloud Project ID for Telemetry in Google Cloud
  - Example: `export OTLP_GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"`.
- **`GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`**:
  - Your Google Cloud Project Location (e.g., us-central1).
  - Required for using Vertex AI in non express mode.
  - If using Vertex AI, ensure you have the necessary permissions and set the `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true` environment variable.
  - Example: `export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="YOUR_PROJECT_LOCATION"`.
- **`GEMINI_SANDBOX`**:
  - Alternative to the `sandbox` setting in `settings.json`.
  - Accepts `true`, `false`, `docker`, `podman`, or a custom command string.
- **`SEATBELT_PROFILE`** (macOS specific):
  - Switches the Seatbelt (`sandbox-exec`) profile on macOS.
  - `permissive-open`: (Default) Restricts writes to the project folder (and a few other folders, see `packages/cli/src/utils/sandbox-macos-permissive-open.sb`) but allows other operations.
  - `strict`: Uses a strict profile that declines operations by default.
  - `<profile_name>`: Uses a custom profile. To define a custom profile, create a file named `sandbox-macos-<profile_name>.sb` in your project's `.gemini/` directory (e.g., `my-project/.gemini/sandbox-macos-custom.sb`).
- **`DEBUG` or `DEBUG_MODE`** (often used by underlying libraries or the CLI itself):
  - Set to `true` or `1` to enable verbose debug logging, which can be helpful for troubleshooting.
- **`NO_COLOR`**:
  - Set to any value to disable all color output in the CLI.
- **`CLI_TITLE`**:
  - Set to a string to customize the title of the CLI.
- **`CODE_ASSIST_ENDPOINT`**:
  - Specifies the endpoint for the code assist server.
  - This is useful for development and testing.

## Command-Line Arguments

Arguments passed directly when running the CLI can override other configurations for that specific session.

- **`--model <model_name>`** (**`-m <model_name>`**):
  - Specifies the Gemini model to use for this session.
  - Example: `npm start -- --model gemini-1.5-pro-latest`
- **`--prompt <your_prompt>`** (**`-p <your_prompt>`**):
  - Used to pass a prompt directly to the command. This invokes Gemini CLI in a non-interactive mode.
- **`--sandbox`** (**`-s`**):
  - Enables sandbox mode for this session.
- **`--sandbox-image`**:
  - Sets the sandbox image URI.
- **`--debug_mode`** (**`-d`**):

  - Enables logging of prompts for telemetry. See [telemetry](../telemetry.md) for more information.
- **`--checkpointing`**:
  - Enables [checkpointing](./commands.md#checkpointing-commands).
- **`--version`**:
  - Displays the version of the CLI.

## Context Files (Hierarchical Instructional Context)

While not strictly configuration for the CLI's _behavior_, context files (defaulting to `GEMINI.md` but configurable via the `contextFileName` setting) are crucial for configuring the _instructional context_ (also referred to as "memory") provided to the Gemini model. This powerful feature allows you to give project-specific instructions, coding style guides, or any relevant background information to the AI, making its responses more tailored and accurate to your needs. The CLI includes UI elements, such as an indicator in the footer showing the number of loaded context files, to keep you informed about the active context.

- **Purpose:** These Markdown files contain instructions, guidelines, or context that you want the Gemini model to be aware of during your interactions. The system is designed to manage this instructional context hierarchically.

### Example Context File Content (e.g., `GEMINI.md`)

Here's a conceptual example of what a context file at the root of a TypeScript project might contain:

```markdown
# Project: My Awesome TypeScript Library

## General Instructions:

- When generating new TypeScript code, please follow the existing coding style.
- Ensure all new functions and classes have JSDoc comments.
- Prefer functional programming paradigms where appropriate.
- All code should be compatible with TypeScript 5.0 and Node.js 18+.

## Coding Style:

- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Interface names should be prefixed with `I` (e.g., `IUserService`).
- Private class members should be prefixed with an underscore (`_`).
- Always use strict equality (`===` and `!==`).

## Specific Component: `src/api/client.ts`

- This file handles all outbound API requests.
- When adding new API call functions, ensure they include robust error handling and logging.
- Use the existing `fetchWithRetry` utility for all GET requests.

## Regarding Dependencies:

- Avoid introducing new external dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
- If a new dependency is required, please state the reason.
```

This example demonstrates how you can provide general project context, specific coding conventions, and even notes about particular files or components. The more relevant and precise your context files are, the better the AI can assist you. Project-specific context files are highly encouraged to establish conventions and context.

- **Hierarchical Loading and Precedence:** The CLI implements a sophisticated hierarchical memory system by loading context files (e.g., `GEMINI.md`) from several locations. Content from files lower in this list (more specific) typically overrides or supplements content from files higher up (more general). The exact concatenation order and final context can be inspected using the `/memory show` command. The typical loading order is:
  1.  **Global Context File:**
      - Location: `~/.gemini/<contextFileName>` (e.g., `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` in your user home directory).
      - Scope: Provides default instructions for all your projects.
  2.  **Project Root & Ancestors Context Files:**
      - Location: The CLI searches for the configured context file in the current working directory and then in each parent directory up to either the project root (identified by a `.git` folder) or your home directory.
      - Scope: Provides context relevant to the entire project or a significant portion of it.
  3.  **Sub-directory Context Files (Contextual/Local):**
      - Location: The CLI also scans for the configured context file in subdirectories _below_ the current working directory (respecting common ignore patterns like `node_modules`, `.git`, etc.).
      - Scope: Allows for highly specific instructions relevant to a particular component, module, or sub-section of your project.
- **Concatenation & UI Indication:** The contents of all found context files are concatenated (with separators indicating their origin and path) and provided as part of the system prompt to the Gemini model. The CLI footer displays the count of loaded context files, giving you a quick visual cue about the active instructional context.
- **Commands for Memory Management:**
  - Use `/memory refresh` to force a re-scan and reload of all context files from all configured locations. This updates the AI's instructional context.
  - Use `/memory show` to display the combined instructional context currently loaded, allowing you to verify the hierarchy and content being used by the AI.
  - See the [Commands documentation](./commands.md#memory) for full details on the `/memory` command and its sub-commands (`show` and `refresh`).

By understanding and utilizing these configuration layers and the hierarchical nature of context files, you can effectively manage the AI's memory and tailor the Gemini CLI's responses to your specific needs and projects.

## Sandboxing

The Gemini CLI can execute potentially unsafe operations (like shell commands and file modifications) within a sandboxed environment to protect your system.

Sandboxing is disabled by default, but you can enable it in a few ways:

- Using `--sandbox` or `-s` flag.
- Setting `GEMINI_SANDBOX` environment variable.
- Sandbox is enabled in `--yolo` mode by default.

By default, it uses a pre-built `gemini-cli-sandbox` Docker image.

For project-specific sandboxing needs, you can create a custom Dockerfile at `.gemini/sandbox.Dockerfile` in your project's root directory. This Dockerfile can be based on the base sandbox image:

```dockerfile
FROM gemini-cli-sandbox

# Add your custom dependencies or configurations here
# For example:
# RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y some-package
# COPY ./my-config /app/my-config
```

When `.gemini/sandbox.Dockerfile` exists, you can use `BUILD_SANDBOX` environment variable when running Gemini CLI to automatically build the custom sandbox image:

```bash
BUILD_SANDBOX=1 gemini -s
```

## Usage Statistics

To help us improve the Gemini CLI, we collect anonymized usage statistics. This data helps us understand how the CLI is used, identify common issues, and prioritize new features.

**What we collect:**

- **Tool Calls:** We log the names of the tools that are called, whether they succeed or fail, and how long they take to execute. We do not collect the arguments passed to the tools or any data returned by them.
- **API Requests:** We log the Gemini model used for each request, the duration of the request, and whether it was successful. We do not collect the content of the prompts or responses.
- **Session Information:** We collect information about the configuration of the CLI, such as the enabled tools and the approval mode.

**What we DON'T collect:**

- **Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** We do not collect any personal information, such as your name, email address, or API keys.
- **Prompt and Response Content:** We do not log the content of your prompts or the responses from the Gemini model.
- **File Content:** We do not log the content of any files that are read or written by the CLI.

**How to opt out:**

You can opt out of usage statistics collection at any time by setting the `usageStatisticsEnabled` property to `false` in your `settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "usageStatisticsEnabled": false
}
```

# Checkpointing

The Gemini CLI includes a Checkpointing feature that automatically saves a snapshot of your project's state before any file modifications are made by AI-powered tools. This allows you to safely experiment with and apply code changes, knowing you can instantly revert back to the state before the tool was run.

## How It Works

When you approve a tool that modifies the file system (like `write_file` or `replace`), the CLI automatically creates a "checkpoint." This checkpoint includes:

1.  **A Git Snapshot:** A commit is made in a special, shadow Git repository located in your home directory (`~/.gemini/history/<project_hash>`). This snapshot captures the complete state of your project files at that moment. It does **not** interfere with your own project's Git repository.
2.  **Conversation History:** The entire conversation you've had with the agent up to that point is saved.
3.  **The Tool Call:** The specific tool call that was about to be executed is also stored.

If you want to undo the change or simply go back, you can use the `/restore` command. Restoring a checkpoint will:

- Revert all files in your project to the state captured in the snapshot.
- Restore the conversation history in the CLI.
- Re-propose the original tool call, allowing you to run it again, modify it, or simply ignore it.

All checkpoint data, including the Git snapshot and conversation history, is stored locally on your machine. The Git snapshot is stored in the shadow repository while the conversation history and tool calls are saved in a JSON file in your project's temporary directory, typically located at `~/.gemini/tmp/<project_hash>/checkpoints`.

## Enabling the Feature

The Checkpointing feature is disabled by default. To enable it, you can either use a command-line flag or edit your `settings.json` file.

### Using the Command-Line Flag

You can enable checkpointing for the current session by using the `--checkpointing` flag when starting the Gemini CLI:

```bash
gemini --checkpointing
```

### Using the `settings.json` File

To enable checkpointing by default for all sessions, you need to edit your `settings.json` file.

Add the following key to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "checkpointing": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

## Using the `/restore` Command

Once enabled, checkpoints are created automatically. To manage them, you use the `/restore` command.

### List Available Checkpoints

To see a list of all saved checkpoints for the current project, simply run:

```
/restore
```

The CLI will display a list of available checkpoint files. These file names are typically composed of a timestamp, the name of the file being modified, and the name of the tool that was about to be run (e.g., `2025-06-22T10-00-00_000Z-my-file.txt-write_file`).

### Restore a Specific Checkpoint

To restore your project to a specific checkpoint, use the checkpoint file from the list:

```
/restore <checkpoint_file>
```

For example:

```
/restore 2025-06-22T10-00-00_000Z-my-file.txt-write_file
```

After running the command, your files and conversation will be immediately restored to the state they were in when the checkpoint was created, and the original tool prompt will reappear.

# Gemini CLI Extensions

Gemini CLI supports extensions that can be used to configure and extend its functionality.

## How it works

On startup, Gemini CLI looks for extensions in two locations:

1.  `<workspace>/.gemini/extensions`
2.  `<home>/.gemini/extensions`

Gemini CLI loads all extensions from both locations. If an extension with the same name exists in both locations, the extension in the workspace directory takes precedence.

Within each location, individual extensions exist as a directory that contains a `gemini-extension.json` file. For example:

`<workspace>/.gemini/extensions/my-extension/gemini-extension.json`

### `gemini-extension.json`

The `gemini-extension.json` file contains the configuration for the extension. The file has the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "my-extension",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "command": "node my-server.js"
    }
  },
  "contextFileName": "GEMINI.md"
}
```

- `name`: The name of the extension. This is used to uniquely identify the extension. This should match the name of your extension directory.
- `version`: The version of the extension.
- `mcpServers`: A map of MCP servers to configure. The key is the name of the server, and the value is the server configuration. These servers will be loaded on startup just like MCP servers configured in a [`settings.json` file](./cli/configuration.md). If both an extension and a `settings.json` file configure an MCP server with the same name, the server defined in the `settings.json` file takes precedence.
- `contextFileName`: The name of the file that contains the context for the extension. This will be used to load the context from the workspace. If this property is not used but a `GEMINI.md` file is present in your extension directory, then that file will be loaded.

When Gemini CLI starts, it loads all the extensions and merges their configurations. If there are any conflicts, the workspace configuration takes precedence.

# Gemini CLI Observability Guide

Telemetry provides data about Gemini CLI's performance, health, and usage. By enabling it, you can monitor operations, debug issues, and optimize tool usage through traces, metrics, and structured logs.

Gemini CLI's telemetry system is built on the **[OpenTelemetry] (OTEL)** standard, allowing you to send data to any compatible backend.

[OpenTelemetry]: https://opentelemetry.io/

## Enabling telemetry

You can enable telemetry in multiple ways. Configuration is primarily managed via the [`.gemini/settings.json` file](./cli/configuration.md) and environment variables, but CLI flags can override these settings for a specific session.

### Order of precedence

The following lists the precedence for applying telemetry settings, with items listed higher having greater precedence:

1.  **CLI flags (for `gemini` command):**

    - `--telemetry` / `--no-telemetry`: Overrides `telemetry.enabled`.
    - `--telemetry-target <local|gcp>`: Overrides `telemetry.target`.
    - `--telemetry-otlp-endpoint <URL>`: Overrides `telemetry.otlpEndpoint`.
    - `--telemetry-log-prompts` / `--no-telemetry-log-prompts`: Overrides `telemetry.logPrompts`.

1.  **Environment variables:**

    - `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`: Overrides `telemetry.otlpEndpoint`.

1.  **Workspace settings file (`.gemini/settings.json`):** Values from the `telemetry` object in this project-specific file.

1.  **User settings file (`~/.gemini/settings.json`):** Values from the `telemetry` object in this global user file.

1.  **Defaults:** applied if not set by any of the above.
    - `telemetry.enabled`: `false`
    - `telemetry.target`: `local`
    - `telemetry.otlpEndpoint`: `http://localhost:4317`
    - `telemetry.logPrompts`: `true`

**For the `npm run telemetry -- --target=<gcp|local>` script:**
The `--target` argument to this script _only_ overrides the `telemetry.target` for the duration and purpose of that script (i.e., choosing which collector to start). It does not permanently change your `settings.json`. The script will first look at `settings.json` for a `telemetry.target` to use as its default.

### Example settings

The following code can be added to your workspace (`.gemini/settings.json`) or user (`~/.gemini/settings.json`) settings to enable telemetry and send the output to Google Cloud:

```json
{
  "telemetry": {
    "enabled": true,
    "target": "gcp"
  },
  "sandbox": false
}
```

## Running an OTEL Collector

An OTEL Collector is a service that receives, processes, and exports telemetry data.
The CLI sends data using the OTLP/gRPC protocol.

Learn more about OTEL exporter standard configuration in [documentation][otel-config-docs].

[otel-config-docs]: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter/

### Local

Use the `npm run telemetry -- --target=local` command to automate the process of setting up a local telemetry pipeline, including configuring the necessary settings in your `.gemini/settings.json` file. The underlying script installs `otelcol-contrib` (the OpenTelemetry Collector) and `jaeger` (The Jaeger UI for viewing traces). To use it:

1.  **Run the command**:
    Execute the command from the root of the repository:

    ```bash
    npm run telemetry -- --target=local
    ```

    The script will:

    - Download Jaeger and OTEL if needed.
    - Start a local Jaeger instance.
    - Start an OTEL collector configured to receive data from Gemini CLI.
    - Automatically enable telemetry in your workspace settings.
    - On exit, disable telemetry.

1.  **View traces**:
    Open your web browser and navigate to **http://localhost:16686** to access the Jaeger UI. Here you can inspect detailed traces of Gemini CLI operations.

1.  **Inspect logs and metrics**:
    The script redirects the OTEL collector output (which includes logs and metrics) to `~/.gemini/tmp/<projectHash>/otel/collector.log`. The script will provide links to view and command to tail your telemetry data (traces, metrics, logs) locally.

1.  **Stop the services**:
    Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the script is running to stop the OTEL Collector and Jaeger services.

### Google Cloud

Use the `npm run telemetry -- --target=gcp` command to automate setting up a local OpenTelemetry collector that forwards data to your Google Cloud project, including configuring the necessary settings in your `.gemini/settings.json` file. The underlying script installs `otelcol-contrib`. To use it:

1.  **Prerequisites**:

    - Have a Google Cloud project ID.
    - Export the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable to make it available to the OTEL collector.
      ```bash
      export OTLP_GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"
      ```
    - Authenticate with Google Cloud (e.g., run `gcloud auth application-default login` or ensure `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is set).
    - Ensure your Google Cloud account/service account has the necessary IAM roles: "Cloud Trace Agent", "Monitoring Metric Writer", and "Logs Writer".

1.  **Run the command**:
    Execute the command from the root of the repository:

    ```bash
    npm run telemetry -- --target=gcp
    ```

    The script will:

    - Download the `otelcol-contrib` binary if needed.
    - Start an OTEL collector configured to receive data from Gemini CLI and export it to your specified Google Cloud project.
    - Automatically enable telemetry and disable sandbox mode in your workspace settings (`.gemini/settings.json`).
    - Provide direct links to view traces, metrics, and logs in your Google Cloud Console.
    - On exit (Ctrl+C), it will attempt to restore your original telemetry and sandbox settings.

1.  **Run Gemini CLI:**
    In a separate terminal, run your Gemini CLI commands. This generates telemetry data that the collector captures.

1.  **View telemetry in Google Cloud**:
    Use the links provided by the script to navigate to the Google Cloud Console and view your traces, metrics, and logs.

1.  **Inspect local collector logs**:
    The script redirects the local OTEL collector output to `~/.gemini/tmp/<projectHash>/otel/collector-gcp.log`. The script provides links to view and command to tail your collector logs locally.

1.  **Stop the service**:
    Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the script is running to stop the OTEL Collector.

# Gemini CLI Core

Gemini CLI's core package (`packages/core`) is the backend portion of Gemini CLI, handling communication with the Gemini API, managing tools, and processing requests sent from `packages/cli`. For a general overview of Gemini CLI, see the [main documentation page](../index.md).

## Navigating this section

- **[Core tools API](./tools-api.md):** Information on how tools are defined, registered, and used by the core.

## Role of the core

While the `packages/cli` portion of Gemini CLI provides the user interface, `packages/core` is responsible for:

- **Gemini API interaction:** Securely communicating with the Google Gemini API, sending user prompts, and receiving model responses.
- **Prompt engineering:** Constructing effective prompts for the Gemini model, potentially incorporating conversation history, tool definitions, and instructional context from `GEMINI.md` files.
- **Tool management & orchestration:**
  - Registering available tools (e.g., file system tools, shell command execution).
  - Interpreting tool use requests from the Gemini model.
  - Executing the requested tools with the provided arguments.
  - Returning tool execution results to the Gemini model for further processing.
- **Session and state management:** Keeping track of the conversation state, including history and any relevant context required for coherent interactions.
- **Configuration:** Managing core-specific configurations, such as API key access, model selection, and tool settings.

## Security considerations

The core plays a vital role in security:

- **API key management:** It handles the `GEMINI_API_KEY` and ensures it's used securely when communicating with the Gemini API.
- **Tool execution:** When tools interact with the local system (e.g., `run_shell_command`), the core (and its underlying tool implementations) must do so with appropriate caution, often involving sandboxing mechanisms to prevent unintended modifications.

## Chat history compression

To ensure that long conversations don't exceed the token limits of the Gemini model, the core includes a chat history compression feature.

When a conversation approaches the token limit for the configured model, the core automatically compresses the conversation history before sending it to the model. This compression is designed to be lossless in terms of the information conveyed, but it reduces the overall number of tokens used.

You can find the token limits for each model in the [Google AI documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models).

## Model fallback

Gemini CLI includes a model fallback mechanism to ensure that you can continue to use the CLI even if the default "pro" model is rate-limited.

If you are using the default "pro" model and the CLI detects that you are being rate-limited, it automatically switches to the "flash" model for the current session. This allows you to continue working without interruption.

## File discovery service

The file discovery service is responsible for finding files in the project that are relevant to the current context. It is used by the `@` command and other tools that need to access files.

## Memory discovery service

The memory discovery service is responsible for finding and loading the `GEMINI.md` files that provide context to the model. It searches for these files in a hierarchical manner, starting from the current working directory and moving up to the project root and the user's home directory. It also searches in subdirectories.

This allows you to have global, project-level, and component-level context files, which are all combined to provide the model with the most relevant information.

You can use the [`/memory` command](../cli/commands.md) to `show`, `add`, and `refresh` the content of loaded `GEMINI.md` files.

# Gemini CLI Core: Tools API

The Gemini CLI core (`packages/core`) features a robust system for defining, registering, and executing tools. These tools extend the capabilities of the Gemini model, allowing it to interact with the local environment, fetch web content, and perform various actions beyond simple text generation.

## Core Concepts

- **Tool (`tools.ts`):** An interface and base class (`BaseTool`) that defines the contract for all tools. Each tool must have:

  - `name`: A unique internal name (used in API calls to Gemini).
  - `displayName`: A user-friendly name.
  - `description`: A clear explanation of what the tool does, which is provided to the Gemini model.
  - `parameterSchema`: A JSON schema defining the parameters the tool accepts. This is crucial for the Gemini model to understand how to call the tool correctly.
  - `validateToolParams()`: A method to validate incoming parameters.
  - `getDescription()`: A method to provide a human-readable description of what the tool will do with specific parameters before execution.
  - `shouldConfirmExecute()`: A method to determine if user confirmation is required before execution (e.g., for potentially destructive operations).
  - `execute()`: The core method that performs the tool's action and returns a `ToolResult`.

- **`ToolResult` (`tools.ts`):** An interface defining the structure of a tool's execution outcome:

  - `llmContent`: The factual string content to be included in the history sent back to the LLM for context.
  - `returnDisplay`: A user-friendly string (often Markdown) or a special object (like `FileDiff`) for display in the CLI.

- **Tool Registry (`tool-registry.ts`):** A class (`ToolRegistry`) responsible for:
  - **Registering Tools:** Holding a collection of all available built-in tools (e.g., `ReadFileTool`, `ShellTool`).
  - **Discovering Tools:** It can also discover tools dynamically:
    - **Command-based Discovery:** If `toolDiscoveryCommand` is configured in settings, this command is executed. It's expected to output JSON describing custom tools, which are then registered as `DiscoveredTool` instances.
    - **MCP-based Discovery:** If `mcpServerCommand` is configured, the registry can connect to a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to list and register tools (`DiscoveredMCPTool`).
  - **Providing Schemas:** Exposing the `FunctionDeclaration` schemas of all registered tools to the Gemini model, so it knows what tools are available and how to use them.
  - **Retrieving Tools:** Allowing the core to get a specific tool by name for execution.

## Built-in Tools

The core comes with a suite of pre-defined tools, typically found in `packages/core/src/tools/`. These include:

- **File System Tools:**
  - `LSTool` (`ls.ts`): Lists directory contents.
  - `ReadFileTool` (`read-file.ts`): Reads the content of a single file. It takes an `absolute_path` parameter, which must be an absolute path.
  - `WriteFileTool` (`write-file.ts`): Writes content to a file.
  - `GrepTool` (`grep.ts`): Searches for patterns in files.
  - `GlobTool` (`glob.ts`): Finds files matching glob patterns.
  - `EditTool` (`edit.ts`): Performs in-place modifications to files (often requiring confirmation).
  - `ReadManyFilesTool` (`read-many-files.ts`): Reads and concatenates content from multiple files or glob patterns (used by the `@` command in CLI).
- **Execution Tools:**
  - `ShellTool` (`shell.ts`): Executes arbitrary shell commands (requires careful sandboxing and user confirmation).
- **Web Tools:**
  - `WebFetchTool` (`web-fetch.ts`): Fetches content from a URL.
  - `WebSearchTool` (`web-search.ts`): Performs a web search.
- **Memory Tools:**
  - `MemoryTool` (`memoryTool.ts`): Interacts with the AI's memory.

Each of these tools extends `BaseTool` and implements the required methods for its specific functionality.

## Tool Execution Flow

1.  **Model Request:** The Gemini model, based on the user's prompt and the provided tool schemas, decides to use a tool and returns a `FunctionCall` part in its response, specifying the tool name and arguments.
2.  **Core Receives Request:** The core parses this `FunctionCall`.
3.  **Tool Retrieval:** It looks up the requested tool in the `ToolRegistry`.
4.  **Parameter Validation:** The tool's `validateToolParams()` method is called.
5.  **Confirmation (if needed):**
    - The tool's `shouldConfirmExecute()` method is called.
    - If it returns details for confirmation, the core communicates this back to the CLI, which prompts the user.
    - The user's decision (e.g., proceed, cancel) is sent back to the core.
6.  **Execution:** If validated and confirmed (or if no confirmation is needed), the core calls the tool's `execute()` method with the provided arguments and an `AbortSignal` (for potential cancellation).
7.  **Result Processing:** The `ToolResult` from `execute()` is received by the core.
8.  **Response to Model:** The `llmContent` from the `ToolResult` is packaged as a `FunctionResponse` and sent back to the Gemini model so it can continue generating a user-facing response.
9.  **Display to User:** The `returnDisplay` from the `ToolResult` is sent to the CLI to show the user what the tool did.

## Extending with Custom Tools

While direct programmatic registration of new tools by users isn't explicitly detailed as a primary workflow in the provided files for typical end-users, the architecture supports extension through:

- **Command-based Discovery:** Advanced users or project administrators can define a `toolDiscoveryCommand` in `settings.json`. This command, when run by the Gemini CLI core, should output a JSON array of `FunctionDeclaration` objects. The core will then make these available as `DiscoveredTool` instances. The corresponding `toolCallCommand` would then be responsible for actually executing these custom tools.
- **MCP Server(s):** For more complex scenarios, one or more MCP servers can be set up and configured via the `mcpServers` setting in `settings.json`. The Gemini CLI core can then discover and use tools exposed by these servers. As mentioned, if you have multiple MCP servers, the tool names will be prefixed with the server name from your configuration (e.g., `serverAlias__actualToolName`).

This tool system provides a flexible and powerful way to augment the Gemini model's capabilities, making the Gemini CLI a versatile assistant for a wide range of tasks.

# Gemini CLI tools

The Gemini CLI includes built-in tools that the Gemini model uses to interact with your local environment, access information, and perform actions. These tools enhance the CLI's capabilities, enabling it to go beyond text generation and assist with a wide range of tasks.

## Overview of Gemini CLI tools

In the context of the Gemini CLI, tools are specific functions or modules that the Gemini model can request to be executed. For example, if you ask Gemini to "Summarize the contents of `my_document.txt`," the model will likely identify the need to read that file and will request the execution of the `read_file` tool.

The core component (`packages/core`) manages these tools, presents their definitions (schemas) to the Gemini model, executes them when requested, and returns the results to the model for further processing into a user-facing response.

These tools provide the following capabilities:

- **Access local information:** Tools allow Gemini to access your local file system, read file contents, list directories, etc.
- **Execute commands:** With tools like `run_shell_command`, Gemini can run shell commands (with appropriate safety measures and user confirmation).
- **Interact with the web:** Tools can fetch content from URLs.
- **Take actions:** Tools can modify files, write new files, or perform other actions on your system (again, typically with safeguards).
- **Ground responses:** By using tools to fetch real-time or specific local data, Gemini's responses can be more accurate, relevant, and grounded in your actual context.

## How to use Gemini CLI tools

To use Gemini CLI tools, provide a prompt to the Gemini CLI. The process works as follows:

1.  You provide a prompt to the Gemini CLI.
2.  The CLI sends the prompt to the core.
3.  The core, along with your prompt and conversation history, sends a list of available tools and their descriptions/schemas to the Gemini API.
4.  The Gemini model analyzes your request. If it determines that a tool is needed, its response will include a request to execute a specific tool with certain parameters.
5.  The core receives this tool request, validates it, and (often after user confirmation for sensitive operations) executes the tool.
6.  The output from the tool is sent back to the Gemini model.
7.  The Gemini model uses the tool's output to formulate its final answer, which is then sent back through the core to the CLI and displayed to you.

You will typically see messages in the CLI indicating when a tool is being called and whether it succeeded or failed.

## Security and confirmation

Many tools, especially those that can modify your file system or execute commands (`write_file`, `edit`, `run_shell_command`), are designed with safety in mind. The Gemini CLI will typically:

- **Require confirmation:** Prompt you before executing potentially sensitive operations, showing you what action is about to be taken.
- **Utilize sandboxing:** All tools are subject to restrictions enforced by sandboxing (see [README](../../README.md#sandboxing)). This means that when operating in a sandbox, any tools (including MCP servers) you wish to use must be available _inside_ the sandbox environment. For example, to run an MCP server through `npx`, the `npx` executable must be installed within the sandbox's Docker image or be available in the `sandbox-exec` environment.

It's important to always review confirmation prompts carefully before allowing a tool to proceed.

## Learn more about Gemini CLI's tools

Gemini CLI's built-in tools can be broadly categorized as follows:

- **[File System Tools](./file-system.md):** For interacting with files and directories (reading, writing, listing, searching, etc.).
- **[Shell Tool](./shell.md) (`run_shell_command`):** For executing shell commands.
- **[Web Fetch Tool](./web-fetch.md) (`web_fetch`):** For retrieving content from URLs.
- **[Web Search Tool](./web-search.md) (`web_search`):** For searching the web.
- **[Multi-File Read Tool](./multi-file.md) (`read_many_files`):** A specialized tool for reading content from multiple files or directories, often used by the `@` command.
- **[Memory Tool](./memory.md) (`save_memory`):** For saving and recalling information across sessions.

Additionally, these tools incorporate:

- **[MCP servers](./mcp-server.md)**: MCP servers act as a bridge between the Gemini model and your local environment or other services like APIs.
- **[Sandboxing](../sandbox.md)**: Sandboxing isolates the model and its changes from your environment to reduce potential risk.

# Gemini CLI file system tools

The Gemini CLI provides a comprehensive suite of tools for interacting with the local file system. These tools allow the Gemini model to read from, write to, list, search, and modify files and directories, all under your control and typically with confirmation for sensitive operations.

**Note:** All file system tools operate within a `rootDirectory` (usually the current working directory where you launched the CLI) for security. Paths that you provide to these tools are generally expected to be absolute or are resolved relative to this root directory.

  - For other binary files: A message like `Cannot display content of binary file: /path/to/data.bin`.
- **Confirmation:** No.

## 3. `write_file` (WriteFile)

`write_file` writes content to a specified file. If the file exists, it will be overwritten. If the file doesn't exist, it (and any necessary parent directories) will be created.

- **Tool name:** `write_file`
- **Display name:** WriteFile
- **File:** `write-file.ts`
- **Parameters:**
  - `file_path` (string, required): The absolute path to the file to write to.

- **Confirmation:** No.

## 5. `search_file_content` (SearchText)

`search_file_content` searches for a regular expression pattern within the content of files in a specified directory. Can filter files by a glob pattern. Returns the lines containing matches, along with their file paths and line numbers.

- **Tool name:** `search_file_content`
- **Display name:** SearchText

  ---
  File: src/index.ts
  L5: import { myFunction } from './utils';
  ---
  ```
- **Confirmation:** No.
- **Confirmation:** No.

## 6. `replace` (Edit)

`replace` replaces text within a file. By default, replaces a single occurrence, but can replace multiple occurrences when `expected_replacements` is specified. This tool is designed for precise, targeted changes and requires significant context around the `old_string` to ensure it modifies the correct location.

- **Tool name:** `replace`
- **Display name:** Edit
- **File:** `edit.ts`
- **Parameters:**

  - `file_path` (string, required): The absolute path to the file to modify.
  - `old_string` (string, required): The exact literal text to replace.

    **CRITICAL:** This string must uniquely identify the single instance to change. It should include at least 3 lines of context _before_ and _after_ the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If `old_string` is empty, the tool attempts to create a new file at `file_path` with `new_string` as content.

  - `new_string` (string, required): The exact literal text to replace `old_string` with.
  - `expected_replacements` (number, optional): The number of occurrences to replace. Defaults to `1`.

- **Behavior:**
  - If `old_string` is empty and `file_path` does not exist, creates a new file with `new_string` as content.
  - If `old_string` is provided, it reads the `file_path` and attempts to find exactly one occurrence of `old_string`.
  - If one occurrence is found, it replaces it with `new_string`.
  - **Enhanced Reliability (Multi-Stage Edit Correction):** To significantly improve the success rate of edits, especially when the model-provided `old_string` might not be perfectly precise, the tool incorporates a multi-stage edit correction mechanism.
  - If the initial `old_string` isn't found or matches multiple locations, the tool can leverage the Gemini model to iteratively refine `old_string` (and potentially `new_string`).
  - This self-correction process attempts to identify the unique segment the model intended to modify, making the `replace` operation more robust even with slightly imperfect initial context.
- **Failure Conditions:** Despite the correction mechanism, the tool will fail if:
  - `file_path` is not absolute or is outside the root directory.
  - `old_string` is not empty, but the `file_path` does not exist.
  - `old_string` is empty, but the `file_path` already exists.
  - `old_string` is not found in the file after attempts to correct it.
  - `old_string` is found multiple times, and the self-correction mechanism cannot resolve it to a single, unambiguous match.
- **Output (`llmContent`):**
  - On success: `Successfully modified file: /path/to/file.txt (1 replacements).` or `Created new file: /path/to/new_file.txt with provided content.`
  - On failure: An error message explaining the reason (e.g., `Failed to edit, 0 occurrences found...`, `Failed to edit, expected 1 occurrences but found 2...`).
- **Confirmation:** Yes. Shows a diff of the proposed changes and asks for user approval before writing to the file.

  - `new_string` (string, required): The exact literal text to replace `old_string` with.
  - `expected_replacements` (number, optional): The number of occurrences to replace. Defaults to `1`.

- **Behavior:**
  - If `old_string` is empty and `file_path` does not exist, creates a new file with `new_string` as content.
  - If `old_string` is provided, it reads the `file_path` and attempts to find exactly one occurrence of `old_string`.
  - If one occurrence is found, it replaces it with `new_string`.
  - **Enhanced Reliability (Multi-Stage Edit Correction):** To significantly improve the success rate of edits, especially when the model-provided `old_string` might not be perfectly precise, the tool incorporates a multi-stage edit correction mechanism.
    - If the initial `old_string` isn't found or matches multiple locations, the tool can leverage the Gemini model to iteratively refine `old_string` (and potentially `new_string`).
    - This self-correction process attempts to identify the unique segment the model intended to modify, making the `replace` operation more robust even with slightly imperfect initial context.
- **Failure conditions:** Despite the correction mechanism, the tool will fail if:
  - `file_path` is not absolute or is outside the root directory.
  - `old_string` is not empty, but the `file_path` does not exist.
  - `old_string` is empty, but the `file_path` already exists.
  - `old_string` is not found in the file after attempts to correct it.
  - `old_string` is found multiple times, and the self-correction mechanism cannot resolve it to a single, unambiguous match.
- **Output (`llmContent`):**
  - On success: `Successfully modified file: /path/to/file.txt (1 replacements).` or `Created new file: /path/to/new_file.txt with provided content.`
  - On failure: An error message explaining the reason (e.g., `Failed to edit, 0 occurrences found...`, `Failed to edit, expected 1 occurrences but found 2...`).
- **Confirmation:** Yes. Shows a diff of the proposed changes and asks for user approval before writing to the file.

These file system tools provide a foundation for the Gemini CLI to understand and interact with your local project context.

# Multi File Read Tool (`read_many_files`)

This document describes the `read_many_files` tool for the Gemini CLI.

## Description

Use `read_many_files` to read content from multiple files specified by paths or glob patterns. The behavior of this tool depends on the provided files:

- For text files, this tool concatenates their content into a single string.
- For image (e.g., PNG, JPEG) and PDF files, it reads and returns them as base64-encoded data, provided they are explicitly requested by name or extension.

`read_many_files` can be used to perform tasks such as getting an overview of a codebase, finding where specific functionality is implemented, reviewing documentation, or gathering context from multiple configuration files.

### Arguments

`read_many_files` takes the following arguments:

- `paths` (list[string], required): An array of glob patterns or paths relative to the tool's target directory (e.g., `["src/**/*.ts"]`, `["README.md", "docs/", "assets/logo.png"]`).
- `exclude` (list[string], optional): Glob patterns for files/directories to exclude (e.g., `["**/*.log", "temp/"]`). These are added to default excludes if `useDefaultExcludes` is true.
- `include` (list[string], optional): Additional glob patterns to include. These are merged with `paths` (e.g., `["*.test.ts"]` to specifically add test files if they were broadly excluded, or `["images/*.jpg"]` to include specific image types).
- `recursive` (boolean, optional): Whether to search recursively. This is primarily controlled by `**` in glob patterns. Defaults to `true`.
- `useDefaultExcludes` (boolean, optional): Whether to apply a list of default exclusion patterns (e.g., `node_modules`, `.git`, non image/pdf binary files). Defaults to `true`.
- `respect_git_ignore` (boolean, optional): Whether to respect .gitignore patterns when finding files. Defaults to true.

## How to use `read_many_files` with the Gemini CLI

`read_many_files` searches for files matching the provided `paths` and `include` patterns, while respecting `exclude` patterns and default excludes (if enabled).

- For text files: it reads the content of each matched file (attempting to skip binary files not explicitly requested as image/PDF) and concatenates it into a single string, with a separator `--- {filePath} ---` between the content of each file. Uses UTF-8 encoding by default.
- For image and PDF files: if explicitly requested by name or extension (e.g., `paths: ["logo.png"]` or `include: ["*.pdf"]`), the tool reads the file and returns its content as a base64 encoded string.
- The tool attempts to detect and skip other binary files (those not matching common image/PDF types or not explicitly requested) by checking for null bytes in their initial content.

Usage:

```
read_many_files(paths=["Your files or paths here."], include=["Additional files to include."], exclude=["Files to exclude."], recursive=False, useDefaultExcludes=false, respect_git_ignore=true)
```

## `read_many_files` examples

Read all TypeScript files in the `src` directory:

```
read_many_files(paths=["src/**/*.ts"])
```

Read the main README, all Markdown files in the `docs` directory, and a specific logo image, excluding a specific file:

```
read_many_files(paths=["README.md", "docs/**/*.md", "assets/logo.png"], exclude=["docs/OLD_README.md"])
```

Read all JavaScript files but explicitly including test files and all JPEGs in an `images` folder:

```
read_many_files(paths=["**/*.js"], include=["**/*.test.js", "images/**/*.jpg"], useDefaultExcludes=False)
```

## Important notes

- **Binary file handling:**
  - **Image/PDF files:** The tool can read common image types (PNG, JPEG, etc.) and PDF files, returning them as base64 encoded data. These files _must_ be explicitly targeted by the `paths` or `include` patterns (e.g., by specifying the exact filename like `image.png` or a pattern like `*.jpeg`).
  - **Other binary files:** The tool attempts to detect and skip other types of binary files by examining their initial content for null bytes. The tool excludes these files from its output.
- **Performance:** Reading a very large number of files or very large individual files can be resource-intensive.
- **Path specificity:** Ensure paths and glob patterns are correctly specified relative to the tool's target directory. For image/PDF files, ensure the patterns are specific enough to include them.
- **Default excludes:** Be aware of the default exclusion patterns (like `node_modules`, `.git`) and use `useDefaultExcludes=False` if you need to override them, but do so cautiously.

# Shell Tool (`run_shell_command`)

This document describes the `run_shell_command` tool for the Gemini CLI.

## Description

Use `run_shell_command` to interact with the underlying system, run scripts, or perform command-line operations. `run_shell_command` executes a given shell command. On Windows, the command will be executed with `cmd.exe /c`. On other platforms, the command will be executed with `bash -c`.

### Arguments

`run_shell_command` takes the following arguments:

- `command` (string, required): The exact shell command to execute.
- `description` (string, optional): A brief description of the command's purpose, which will be shown to the user.
- `directory` (string, optional): The directory (relative to the project root) in which to execute the command. If not provided, the command runs in the project root.

## How to use `run_shell_command` with the Gemini CLI

When using `run_shell_command`, the command is executed as a subprocess. `run_shell_command` can start background processes using `&`. The tool returns detailed information about the execution, including:

- `Command`: The command that was executed.
- `Directory`: The directory where the command was run.
- `Stdout`: Output from the standard output stream.
- `Stderr`: Output from the standard error stream.
- `Error`: Any error message reported by the subprocess.
- `Exit Code`: The exit code of the command.
- `Signal`: The signal number if the command was terminated by a signal.
- `Background PIDs`: A list of PIDs for any background processes started.

Usage:

```
run_shell_command(command="Your commands.", description="Your description of the command.", directory="Your execution directory.")
```

## `run_shell_command` examples

List files in the current directory:

```
run_shell_command(command="ls -la")
```

Run a script in a specific directory:

```
run_shell_command(command="./my_script.sh", directory="scripts", description="Run my custom script")
```

Start a background server:

```
run_shell_command(command="npm run dev &", description="Start development server in background")
```

## Important notes

- **Security:** Be cautious when executing commands, especially those constructed from user input, to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- **Interactive commands:** Avoid commands that require interactive user input, as this can cause the tool to hang. Use non-interactive flags if available (e.g., `npm init -y`).
- **Error handling:** Check the `Stderr`, `Error`, and `Exit Code` fields to determine if a command executed successfully.
- **Background processes:** When a command is run in the background with `&`, the tool will return immediately and the process will continue to run in the background. The `Background PIDs` field will contain the process ID of the background process.

# Web Fetch Tool (`web_fetch`)

This document describes the `web_fetch` tool for the Gemini CLI.

## Description

Use `web_fetch` to summarize, compare, or extract information from web pages. The `web_fetch` tool processes content from one or more URLs (up to 20) embedded in a prompt. `web_fetch` takes a natural language prompt and returns a generated response.

### Arguments

`web_fetch` takes one argument:

- `prompt` (string, required): A comprehensive prompt that includes the URL(s) (up to 20) to fetch and specific instructions on how to process their content. For example: `"Summarize https://example.com/article and extract key points from https://another.com/data"`. The prompt must contain at least one URL starting with `http://` or `https://`.

## How to use `web_fetch` with the Gemini CLI

To use `web_fetch` with the Gemini CLI, provide a natural language prompt that contains URLs. The tool will ask for confirmation before fetching any URLs. Once confirmed, the tool will process URLs through Gemini API's `urlContext`.

If the Gemini API cannot access the URL, the tool will fall back to fetching content directly from the local machine. The tool will format the response, including source attribution and citations where possible. The tool will then provide the response to the user.

Usage:

```
web_fetch(prompt="Your prompt, including a URL such as https://google.com.")
```

## `web_fetch` examples

Summarize a single article:

```
web_fetch(prompt="Can you summarize the main points of https://example.com/news/latest")
```

Compare two articles:

```
web_fetch(prompt="What are the differences in the conclusions of these two papers: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.0001 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.0002?")
```

## Important notes

- **URL processing:** `web_fetch` relies on the Gemini API's ability to access and process the given URLs.
- **Output quality:** The quality of the output will depend on the clarity of the instructions in the prompt.

# Web Search Tool (`google_web_search`)

This document describes the `google_web_search` tool.

## Description

Use `google_web_search` to perform a web search using Google Search via the Gemini API. The `google_web_search` tool returns a summary of web results with sources.

### Arguments

`google_web_search` takes one argument:

- `query` (string, required): The search query.

## How to use `google_web_search` with the Gemini CLI

The `google_web_search` tool sends a query to the Gemini API, which then performs a web search. `google_web_search` will return a generated response based on the search results, including citations and sources.

Usage:

```
google_web_search(query="Your query goes here.")
```

## `google_web_search` examples

Get information on a topic:

```
google_web_search(query="latest advancements in AI-powered code generation")
```

## Important notes

- **Response returned:** The `google_web_search` tool returns a processed summary, not a raw list of search results.
- **Citations:** The response includes citations to the sources used to generate the summary.

# Memory Tool (`save_memory`)

This document describes the `save_memory` tool for the Gemini CLI.

## Description

Use `save_memory` to save and recall information across your Gemini CLI sessions. With `save_memory`, you can direct the CLI to remember key details across sessions, providing personalized and directed assistance.

### Arguments

`save_memory` takes one argument:

- `fact` (string, required): The specific fact or piece of information to remember. This should be a clear, self-contained statement written in natural language.

## How to use `save_memory` with the Gemini CLI

The tool appends the provided `fact` to a special `GEMINI.md` file located in the user's home directory (`~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`). This file can be configured to have a different name.

Once added, the facts are stored under a `## Gemini Added Memories` section. This file is loaded as context in subsequent sessions, allowing the CLI to recall the saved information.

Usage:

```
save_memory(fact="Your fact here.")
```

### `save_memory` examples

Remember a user preference:

```
save_memory(fact="My preferred programming language is Python.")
```

Store a project-specific detail:

```
save_memory(fact="The project I'm currently working on is called 'gemini-cli'.")
```

## Important notes

- **General usage:** This tool should be used for concise, important facts. It is not intended for storing large amounts of data or conversational history.
- **Memory file:** The memory file is a plain text Markdown file, so you can view and edit it manually if needed.
