  This task aims to definitively resolve persistent failures in frontend tests (`frontend/src/App.test.tsx`) and a `ModuleNotFoundError` in the backend Docker container.

  It builds upon the reported fixes in `task-043`, which was marked as 'done'. The first step of this task will be to verify if the solutions from `task-043` are present and effective in the current codebase.

  **1. Backend `ModuleNotFoundError` (Ref: `task-036`, `task-043`):**
      - Issue: Backend container fails to start due to `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'` (or similar, if imports were changed).
      - Reported Fix in `task-043`:
          - Python imports changed from `from backend.module` to `from module` (e.g., `from orchestrator import Orchestrator`).
          - `PYTHONPATH=/app` added to `backend` service in `docker-compose.yml`.
      - Verification & Action:
          - Check `backend/main.py` and other relevant Python files for import statements.
          - Check `docker-compose.yml` for `PYTHONPATH=/app` in the backend service.
          - Check the backend `Dockerfile` to confirm how files are copied (e.g., `COPY . /app` or `COPY backend/ /app/backend/`).
          - If the fix is present, confirm `sudo docker compose up --build backend` works.
          - If not present or not working, implement/correct the fix to ensure Python modules are correctly resolved within the `/app` directory of the container. The goal is for imports like `from orchestrator import ...` to work when `orchestrator.py` is at `/app/orchestrator.py`.

  **2. Frontend `App.test.tsx` Failures (Ref: `task-034`, `task-037`, `task-038`, `task-042`, `task-043`):**
      - Issue: Tests related to session initialization in `App.test.tsx` fail (e.g., `ProjectNameInput` not hidden, `ChatInterfacePlaceholder` not shown), often with `act(...)` warnings.
      - Reported Fixes in `task-043`:
          - `react-scripts` version corrected to `^5.0.1` in `frontend/package.json`.
          - URLs in `frontend/src/services/__tests__/api.test.ts` corrected to include `/api` prefix.
          - `App.test.tsx` test structure for async operations (session start) modified, reportedly successfully using `await mockApi.startSession.mock.results[0].value;` within an `act` block.
      - Verification & Action:
          - Check `frontend/package.json` for `react-scripts` version.
          - Check `frontend/src/services/__tests__/api.test.ts` for corrected API call assertions.
          - Thoroughly review `frontend/src/App.test.tsx`, comparing it against the successful pattern described in `task-043`.
          - If fixes are present, run `npm test --prefix frontend -- --watchAll=false --ci --json --outputFile=test-results.json` to confirm all tests pass and `act` warnings are resolved.
          - If not present or not working, re-implement or refine the solution. This involves:
              - Ensuring `startSession` mock (from `frontend/src/services/api.ts`) is correctly configured and its promise resolves as expected within the test.
              - Correctly using `React Testing Library` utilities (`act`, `waitFor`, `findBy*`, `userEvent`) to handle asynchronous updates to `App.tsx`'s state (`sessionData`) and subsequent conditional rendering.

## Arquivos Relevantes (Escopo da Tarefa)
*   `frontend/src/App.tsx`
*   `frontend/src/App.test.tsx`
*   `frontend/src/components/ProjectNameInput.tsx`
*   `frontend/src/services/api.ts`
*   `frontend/src/services/__tests__/api.test.ts`
*   `frontend/package.json`
*   `backend/main.py`
*   `backend/orchestrator.py` (and other backend modules)
*   `Dockerfile` (the one used for the backend service, likely `backend/Dockerfile` or a global one)
*   `docker-compose.yml`

## Critérios de Aceitação
1.  The solutions reported as successful in `task-043` are verified. If discrepancies are found, they are corrected.
2.  The backend container (`backend` service in `docker-compose.yml`) builds and starts successfully without any `ModuleNotFoundError`. This can be verified by `sudo docker compose up --build backend -d` followed by checking logs with `sudo docker compose logs backend`.
3.  All frontend tests pass when running `npm test --prefix frontend -- --watchAll=false --ci`. This includes:
    *   Tests in `frontend/src/App.test.tsx` related to session initialization now pass (e.g., `ProjectNameInput` is hidden, and `ChatInterfacePlaceholder` is shown after session start).
    *   Tests in `frontend/src/services/__tests__/api.test.ts` pass.
4.  There are no `act(...)` warnings in the frontend test output.
5.  The underlying issues causing `task-034`, `task-036`, `task-038`, and `task-042` to fail are definitively resolved.

## Observações Adicionais
This task prioritizes verifying the fixes from `task-043`. If those fixes are correctly in place and the issues persist, further investigation will be needed.
The `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps are placeholders.
Ensure Docker commands use `sudo docker compose` as per general instructions.
